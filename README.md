📢 Version 1.0 & Sustainability Note
We are excited to announce that Swiss Knife Toolbox v1.0 is now officially available for download!

**Why a closed-source release?**
To ensure the long-term sustainability of the project and to continue providing premium cloud features at no cost to the end-user, version 1.0 is released as a compiled package.

Maintaining high-performance cloud services and providing free access to specialized APIs (like Google Gemini and AudD Music Recognition) involves significant hosting and licensing costs. To keep the application free for everyone, we are moving towards a sustainable model supported by non-intrusive ads on our platform (sktoolbox.pro). This allows us to:

- Keep the core app free to download and use.
- Cover the costs of Cloud Storage & Sync for your screenshots.
- Plan for future integrated API access, removing the need for users to provide their own keys.

## ✨ Key Features
